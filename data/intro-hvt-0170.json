This is due, to some extent, to the lack of sources, as for a long time converted Jews did not speak out about this topic. Yaakov Ariel rightly argues in a seminal article on conversions of Jews to Christianity during the Holocaust that, while a number of authors wrote during the 1950s and 1960s about Jews hiding among \u201cAryans,\u201d or about the reclaiming of Jewish children after the war, their narratives carried \u201ca Jewish heroic undertone,\u201d \u201clargely overlooked the religious aspects of conversions, and did not relate to their spiritual and communal contexts.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup> In the last decade, however, interest in the impact of conversions has increased and more steps have been taken to understand this forgotten group of Holocaust survivors.

One of the first countries that came under scrutiny was Hungary, where the number of converted Jews was high. In his most recent edition of <em>The Politics of Genocide</em>, Randolph Braham puts the number of Christians of Jewish origin residing in Hungary in 1941 at up to 100,000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-9\"><a href=\"#fn-9\">9</a></sup> Other historians<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-10\"><a href=\"#fn-10\">10</a></sup> and the <em>YIVO Encyclopaedia of Jews in Eastern Europe</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\">11</a></sup> put forward similar numbers, which are mostly based on statistical data released after the March-April 1941 census. Unfortunately, and this is another sign of the lack of in-depth research, we do not have a critical assessment of these numbers. In Romania, the census of 1942 revealed that 4631, out of 272,573 Jews who remained after the changes of borders and the killings and deportations of 1941-1942, were converts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> However, as in the case of Hungary, there is a need for better understanding of the context in which these censuses were gathered, as threat to life may have influenced whether or not a Jewish person declared him or herself Christian or Jewish. Although in the last decade the topic of conversions in Western Europe appears sporadically in research about Churches\u2019 attitudes during the Holocaust, or the treatment of Jews found in mixed marriages, we lack clear numbers and a clear overview of how widespread this phenomenon was in specific countries.

From the beginning, they paid special attention to the psychological dimensions of remembering past traumatic experiences.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-13\"><a href=\"#fn-13\">13</a></sup> Moreover, the initial guidelines of the Fortunoff Archive stressed the importance of allowing survivors to remember their experiences without much intervention from the interviewers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-14\"><a href=\"#fn-14\">14</a></sup> However, in my examination of the 97 testimonies I found that the guidelines were not always followed. This was because of the professional formation of the interviewers (Laurel Vlock, for example, tended to follow a media style of interviewing), or because of the expansion of the project to different locations (for example in the interviews done at affiliate locations in Europe, especially in Yugoslavia, the survivors were often guided in their answers by the questions of the interviewer).

I relied on Orbis, the search engine of the Yale University library. Each testimony contains a brief (usually between ten to 20 lines) description of its content. The four searches produced 153 results, of which 97 are testimonies describing in one form or another experiences of conversion of the interviewees, while the rest are either duplicates, irrelevant (as the words refers to something else), or are about conversion of somebody else (usually parents, with only a brief mention). 61 testimonies are from women Holocaust survivors and 36 from men. The vast majority were children at the time of baptism. Conversion to Catholicism is predominant because most testimonies are from countries where Catholicism was the main religion. In terms of countries of origin, the largest number of testimonies is from people who either lived at the time of recording or were originally from Slovakia (26), which is due to the fact that during the 1990s the Fortunoff Archive had an active office in Bratislava, where some of these testimonies were recorded.

However, the first sample of 97 overall testimonies is sufficient to offer an informed view on the way in which survivors remember their experience of conversion. It should be noted that in my documentation for this introduction and the annotated edition, apart from the transcript itself, the other 96 testimonies, and relevant secondary literature, I relied also on the two boxes of Hans Frei personal documents found in the Yale Divinity School Library and on two boxes of Fortunoff Archive documents found in the Yale University\u2019s Sterling Memorial Library.

He was born in 1922 in Breslau, then part of Germany, into a family of Jewish parents who had converted to Christianity in their early adulthood. His father, Wilhelm Siegmund Frei, was a professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Breslau, and his mother, Magda Frankfurther Frei, was a medic. Hans was the youngest of three children. As he explains at one point in his testimony, he and his siblings were baptised into a Protestant Church (most likely Lutheran) soon after birth. In the 1920s the family moved to Berlin after the father got a job at an important hospital in Spandau. Due to his parents\u2019 professional status, the family did not feel the economic depression that ravaged Germany throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s. However, they were impacted by antisemitic policies as soon as Hitler came to power in 1933. In order to avoid the hostile environment, from 1935 until 1938 Hans was sent to a Quaker school in Saffron Walden, Essex, England.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-30\"><a href=\"#fn-30\">30</a></sup> The choice of this school was not necessarily down to religious preference (Hans explains that his parents were not committed Christians, and were not enthusiastic about the Quakers) and probably reflects rather bureaucratic reasons, for the Quakers were relatively relaxed on the currency exchange requirements of the time. Frei developed a close connection with this religious group, but later, after the family moved to the US, identified rather with Lutheranism and Anglicanism.  "

He actually says, in the first sentences of the interview: \u201cWell, I was one of the lucky ones who escaped without ever having seen anything more horrible than some street clashes in Germany.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-31\"><a href=\"#fn-31\">31</a></sup> Nonetheless, his insight into the growing persecution is extremely relevant. As the reader/listener will notice, he talks several times about the terror of those early years: the terror of denunciations, the terror of a growing police state, and the terror of legislation that excluded Jews from the German society and made them unwelcome. Two interesting episodes reflect this sense of terror. In one, probably in 1935, while returning from England Hans missed his train and arrived with the next one. He describes the profound anxiety of his parents who feared the worst. In the second, which happened in 1934 in the context of the Night of the Long Knives, he was at home with his grandmother. An individual who was chased by the police asked to take shelter in their apartment, claiming to have known his father from the trenches in the First World War. In the end Hans, who was 12 at the time, refused to give the man permission to enter; the memory of that event, and the guilt of a missed opportunity to help, were still vivid decades later.  "

It should be mentioned here that, while still in Germany, his father renounced his Christian conversion as a protest against the Nazi persecution of Jews. Unfortunately, the interview does not offer any details about what this renunciation entailed. We do not know whether it was only a private declaration or if any formal steps were made in that direction. However, the episode indicates how the experience of the war may have impacted Hans too. As he left in 1938, he did not have to take shelter in a convent, nor to be hidden conditionally by some villagers, nor to convert as a way of gaining the trust of a convent or a foster family, as most Fortunoff survivors did.

It also provides some information on German Jewish life in New York at the end of the 1930s. There are also glimpses of Frei\u2019s view on post-Second World War German society, and his vision of Israel. First and foremost, however, this is a template interview on how conversion to Christianity impacts Jewish identity and belonging and how second generation converts depart even more from Judaism. Seen through comparative lenses, Frei\u2019s answer to some of these issues are, as explained above, both similar and different to other Holocaust survivors who converted to Christianity. His family\u2019s secularism, attachment to German belonging, and desire to assimilate into that society all shaped Frei\u2019s later identity. The fact that he escaped the most terrible part of the Holocaust was also essential. However, it is interesting that, although all these elements would be sufficient to make him forget his Jewishness, he nevertheless returns to it very often during the interview. And even when he is tempted to deny it, he does so leaving the door open for an eventual reconsideration.  "
