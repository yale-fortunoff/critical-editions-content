Yet such images, horrific as they may be, only convey part of the tragedy. The first large-scale massacres of the Holocaust, which occurred during the June 22, 1941 German invasion of western Soviet territories (Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic States), actually occurred without long-term ghettos, deportations, or gassing facilities. Most of the roughly 2.5 million Jews murdered in these territories were methodically shot over pits in nearby forests. At the same time, nearby forests could serve as sites of refuge and resistance, particularly on the heavily-wooded Belarusian terrain. Timothy Snyder\u2019s explanation for why so many Jews in the Minsk Ghetto managed to evade executions applies to other Belarusian ghettos, as well: Jews in the region \u201chad somewhere to run\u201d.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> "

Only 21-23,000 Jews remained alive in ghettos and camps throughout Belarus. The Germans and their collaborators entered the Zhetl ghetto on August 6-8 and executed around one thousand ghetto inhabitants in the adjacent forest and Jewish cemetery. Around 600 Jews, including Rubin, escaped deep into the forest. A similar pattern occurred in ghettos throughout the region. The death tolls are staggering: in western Belarus, 332-350,000 Jews were murdered while only 8-11,000 survived, mainly in the forests.

Early on, he smuggled weapons for a planned ghetto revolt at great personal risk, and he fought with partisans after his ghetto\u2019s liquidation. Rabbinical opinion during this period actually condoned such conduct. When R. Ephraim Oshry, a ritual legal (<em>halakhic</em>) authority in the Kovno (Kaunus) Ghetto, was asked by a ghetto resident whether it was permissible to escape to the forest and join partisans, he ruled in the affirmative. Despite the personal risk owing to the well-known hatred for Jews among certain Soviet partisans, Oshry reasoned, staying in a ghetto would mean exposing oneself to murder (ghetto residents were popularly known as \u201ceasy kills\u201d, he notes). Escaping to the forests, in contrast, entailed only a \u201cpossible danger\u201d (<em>safek sakanah</em>), since those who resolved to escape were doubtless well-informed of the whereabouts of sympathetic partisans. In fact, Oshry argued, the more Jews who escaped to the forests and joined partisan camps, the more the German \u201cAmalek\u201d would be weakened. Therefore, \u201cone should encourage and fortify them and extend them as much help as possible in obtaining weapons so that they will not come empty-handed to the partisan camps and will be knowledgeable in battle and warfare and poised to be on the front lines at the head of the fighters.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-24\"><a href=\"#fn-24\">24</a></sup> "
