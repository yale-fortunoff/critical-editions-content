The facts, as Riegner notes in his testimony, were well known already in the first few months after the Nazis rose to power. Hitler had spelled out his plan in <i>Mein Kampf</i> – “it is terribly difficult to understand why nobody believed what he said.” Many Jews were dismissed from their jobs – including Riegner himself, who worked as an assistant judge, his father who worked as a lawyer in Berlin and his sister who worked as a teacher. The <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>London Times</i> and other papers reported on the first concentration camps, Oranienburg and Sachsenhausen, in which opponents of the regime were imprisoned. Nazis won majorities in student bodies across Germany – in one instance, Riegner recalls, Nazi students stormed an auditorium and chased out a Jewish professor and Jewish students, Riegner among them, and they were forced to jump through the windows to escape.

After the war, the League conditioned its recognition of several states in Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Romania, Hungary and others, on their committing to protect a set of limited political and cultural rights for their minorities. Those rights included provisions such as a guarantee of equal treatment and protection by the state, the use of minority language in public institutions, such as the courts and elementary schools, and a guarantee of proportional state funding for educational, religious and welfare services.

In 1936, to confront the rise of Nazism and the erosion of Jewish rights throughout Eastern Europe, the leadership of these organizations founded the World Jewish Congress (WJC) to serve as a unified political organization and diplomatic arm of the Jewish people. The WJC was led by Stephen S. Wise, a prominent American reform rabbi and Zionist leader, and Nahum Goldman, a German-Jewish Zionist leader. On the eve of the founding assembly of the WJC, Wise and Goldman sought recommendations for a young lawyer interested in Jewish affairs to work at the WJC.

The first was WJC advocacy on behalf of Jews in Danzig. After World War I, Danzig had been accorded the status of an autonomous “free city,” with its existence and constitution guaranteed by the Council of the League. Because of its unique political status, tens of thousands of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe passed through and temporarily resided in the city, where they were aided by the local Jewish community as they awaited immigration visas. From 1933 onward, the Nazis had won increasing power and ultimately a majority in the local senate. The Nazis introduced antisemitic legislation and persecuted Jews. In his testimony and memoir, Riegner recalls his efforts to fight to protect Jewish rights in Danzig. The WJC repeatedly advocated for the suspension of anti-Jewish legislation before the High Commissioners appointed to Danzig by the League and in various other League bodies. These efforts did not prove very successful. Riegner notes that the only achievement was to delay the introduction of the “Aryan paragraph” in the Danzig bylaws by about a year.  "}},{"id":"rT52iQ0uf5","type":"paragraph","data":{"paragraphType":"paragraph","text":"The second was WJC advocacy on behalf of Jews in Romania. In December 1937, a pro-fascist government was formed in Romania under the leadership of two right-wing leaders, Octavian Goga and Alexander Cuza. This government advocated an alliance with the Third Reich and pursued antisemitic policies modeled after Nazi Germany. The party vowed to establish a regime based on the dominance of the Romanian “race” and to exclude Jews from public life. It pursued a policy aimed at stripping some 250,000-500,000 Jews of their citizenship. After World War I, the League required Romania to grant citizenship and minority rights to hundreds of thousands of Jews from territories newly awarded to Romania in Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania. Successive Romanian governments tried to prevent Jews from acquiring their rightful citizenship, and the Goga-Cuza government sought to annul the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Jews. In his memoir and testimony, Riegner describes the efforts of the WJC to fight these antisemitic policies. In January 1938, Riegner prepared a petition in which the WJC demanded that the League adopt an urgency clause to protect Jews in Romania. In the following weeks, Riegner and other WJC officials met with leaders such as the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yvon Delbos, the British Foreign Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, and Soviet Ambassador Yakov Suritz, while Stephen Wise obtained a declaration from US President Roosevelt in which he expressed his distaste for the persecution of Jews in East Central Europe. The League rejected the WJC demand to invoke the urgency clause but immediately appointed a Committee of Three charged with dealing with the problems raised by the petition ahead of the next session. Ultimately, pressure from the British and French government led to the resignation of the Goga government in February. Britain and France had substantial foreign policy and economic interests in Romania and they opposed a government aligned with Nazi Germany and the fascist axis. By engaging in public advocacy, the WJC succeeded in drawing sustained international attention to the illegitimacy of the Goga government. Riegner observes in his testimony: “this was my first, real, great political fight in-- in my career. It was '38. I had joined in '36, in the end of '36. But this was a real, great fight.

Part of the disbelief, he acknowledges, was related to anti-Jewish sentiment. The British and US governments strictly limited immigration of Jewish refugees and feared that these policies would be further challenged if news of the extermination became widespread. British and US officials also opposed creating the impression that the war was fought for the Jews – either because of their own anti-Jewish prejudices or because they wanted to cater to the prejudices of others. Part of the disbelief, Riegner argues, was also a result of legitimate questions about the credibility of the news. As Riegner observes in his testimony, when British officials first learned about the news “they were puzzled, who is Riegner?” – was his information reliable? But above all, Riegner suggests, their failure to believe the news was because, “in reality, this went beyond human understanding. This is a real-- the only explanation.” Only after several additional reports and confirmations arrived in London and New York, did the Allied governments issue, on December 17th 1942, a declaration stating that Nazi Germany was carrying out a plan of mass extermination of European Jewry. But even after the declaration, Riegner argues, the full meaning and implications of the extermination had not registered in the Allied capitals. Indeed, from late 1942 the press in the Allied capitals regularly published news of massacres of Jews in Europe. Some observers regarded these reports as exaggerated and inaccurate while many became desensitized to them through the sheer volume of horror. As the London based <i>Jewish Standard</i> put it, “Jewish slaughter became an every day affair and the senses of non-Jews were dulled into indifference.” “The whole thing is so starkly tragic,” wrote Harold Ickes, British Secretary of the Interior, in response to a report on massacres of Jews in Poland, “that it saturates the imagination.” One Jewish observes spoke about the “feverish competition” between Jewish bodies “each seeking to anticipate the other” by publishing “still newer and larger horrors.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-16\"><a href=\"#fn-16\">16</a></sup> "}},{"id":"AuW766t3y_","type":"footnoteParagraph","data":{"id":"fn-16","label":"16","text":"For a reporting of these examples see Joseph B.

Many WJC leaders, including Goldman, planned to demand new guarantees for minority rights for Jews in postwar Eastern Europe. In June 1943, Jacob Robinson, head of the postwar planning institute of the WJC, lambasted Goldman and other WJC leaders for embracing this vision. After the war, “the number of Jews left in Europe after the war ... will be so small,” he argued, that any political program aimed at securing collective rights for a sizeable Jewish minority in Eastern Europe was disconnected from reality. Similarly, Richard Lichtheim, head of the Jewish Agency office in Geneva, who worked closely with Riegner during the war, argued in September 1942 that Zionist leaders did not comprehend the news of the extermination. In May 1942, Zionist leaders espoused a plan for the mass immigration of millions of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe to Palestine after the war. But Lichtheim argued that too few Jews would survive to justify a mass immigration plan to Palestine.” The vast extent of the Jewish catastrophe, he declared, meant that the “basis of Zionism as it was understood and preached during the last 50 years has gone.” “Whatever number of Jews will be after this war ... there will be no need for [a] mass emigration” of Jews to Palestine. Both Robinson and Lichtheim continued to advance these argument throughout the war, insisting that Jewish leaders – even as they learned about the extermination – had not adjusted their political thinking to the new postwar reality it entailed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-17\"><a href=\"#fn-17\">17</a></sup> "}},{"id":"WSWSHd5_y5","type":"footnoteParagraph","data":{"id":"fn-17","label":"17","text":"For a discussion of this topic see Gil Rubin, “The Future of the Jews: Planning for the Postwar Jewish World, 1939-1946”(Doctoral Dissertation, Columbia University, 2017).
