This telegram, widely known today as the \u201cRiegner Telegram,\u201d was the first report that claimed that the Nazi were intent on systematically exterminating all of European Jewry.

The details surrounding the production and dissemination of the Riegner Telegram, as well as the international response to it, have been recovered and analyzed in detail in scholarship.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Riegner\u2019s testimony adds significantly to this story by offering a personal point of view. One of the major threads that runs throughout Riegner\u2019s testimony, as we shall see, is his contention that learning about the Nazi extermination plan did not necessarily imply comprehending its meaning. One required a certain psychological disposition and political acumen, his testimony suggests, to be able to conceive of the inconceivable. Moreover, Riegner\u2019s testimony offers insight into the perspective of a group of Jewish leaders who spent the war years collecting information on the events in Europe, fighting to rescue Jews and planning for the Jewish future after the war.

In his autobiography, first published in French in 1998, <em>Never Despair: Sixty Years in the Service of the Jewish People and the Cause of Human Rights</em>, he described his family\u2019s strong German cultural and civic identity. \u201cI come from a cultivated, middle-class Jewish family, of which there were so many in the German Empire before World War I, and in particular in the Weimar Republic. I belong to what is conventionally called the post-assimilationist generation. Our acculturation to German life had been a <em>fait accompli</em> for a long time,\u201d he wrote; \u201cIf we were conscious of our Jewishness, this was the result of a deliberate choice.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> The son of a lawyer and an educator, Riegner\u2019s family line boasted various luminaires of German-Jewish cultural life. His maternal grandmother was the niece of Louis Lewandowski, a pioneer of German synagogue music who served as musical director at the Neue Synagogue in Berlin. Riegner was related to German-Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen, \u201cone of the glories of German Jewry of the era\u201d and one of the most important philosophers and public intellectuals in turn-of-the-century Germany. Riegner would regularly spend Sunday evenings with his family attending gatherings with other notable intellectuals in Cohen\u2019s house.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup> Riegenr was also related to Oskar Cohen, a prominent German-Jewish socialist politician and member of parliament who served as undersecretary in the Ministry of Justice following the November Revolution. Riegner\u2019s upbringing appears a classic example of the German-Jewish cultural symbiosis.  "

Riegner remembers being called a \u201cdirty little Jew\u201d by a classmate; a friend who refused to invite him over to his house because, Riegner intuited, his parents did not want a Jew as a houseguest, and also a sense of hostility from some of his teachers who longed for the monarchy and rejected the Weimar Republic.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup> The assassination in 1922 of Weimar\u2019s German-Jewish Foreign Minister, Walter Rathenau, revealed to the then ten-year-old Riegner the \u201cdepth of anti-Semitism on the German extreme right.

He suggests that this was not a result of some unique access to knowledge of what was happening but rather was based \u201con a political sentiment, political understanding of what was going.\u201d Riegner thus argues for a difference between knowing and understanding. The facts, as Riegner notes in his testimony, were well known already in the first few months after the Nazis rose to power. Hitler had spelled out his plan in <em>Mein Kampf</em> \u2013 \u201cit is terribly difficult to understand why nobody believed what he said.\u201d Many Jews were dismissed from their jobs \u2013 including Riegner himself, who worked as an assistant judge, his father who worked as a lawyer in Berlin and his sister who worked as a teacher. The <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>London Times</em> and other papers reported on the first concentration camps, Oranienburg and Sachsenhausen, in which opponents of the regime were imprisoned. Nazis won majorities in student bodies across Germany \u2013 in one instance, Riegner recalls, Nazi students stormed an auditorium and chased out a Jewish professor and Jewish students, Riegner among them, and they were forced to jump through the windows to escape. Nazis gathered under homes that belonged to Jews \u2013 including Riegner\u2019s family home \u2013 and shouted \u201cJuden Raus!\u201d.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-8\"><a href=\"#fn-8\">8</a></sup> Still, Riegner remembers how he pleaded with his friends to leave. On his last day in Germany, 16th or 17th of May, 1933, he attended a 50th birthday party of a family friend. He recalls pleading with the guests to leave Germany or at least let the younger generation leave. \u201cI have never forgotten \u2013 forgotten this last evening when I told them, don\u2019t you see that this is the end of German Jewry?\u201d  "

Kelsen eventually offered Riegner a two-year fellowship in his international law institute in Geneva, the Swiss Graduate Institute of International Studies. In his testimony, Riegner describes these years of immigration and his experience of loneliness and financial and professional uncertainty in traumatic terms: \u201c\u2026 nobody told me what immigration means, and nobody told others what immigration means, because that's one of the most terrible things which someone has to go through when one decides to leave one's country.\u201d  "

It was home to the League of Nations, an international organization established by the Great Powers in the aftermath of World War I with the goal of maintaining peace in Europe. The League oversaw two institutions that were enormously consequential to the Jews. The first was the international minorities protection regime. After the war, the League conditioned its recognition of several states in Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Romania, Hungary and others, on their committing to protect a set of limited political and cultural rights for their minorities. Those rights included provisions such as a guarantee of equal treatment and protection by the state, the use of minority language in public institutions, such as the courts and elementary schools, and a guarantee of proportional state funding for educational, religious and welfare services. Several mechanisms were established by the League to oversee these guarantees.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\">11</a></sup> The second was the mandates system \u2013 a legal instrument designed by the League to administer former territories of the German and Ottoman empires.

Many Jewish political leaders and thinkers envisioned the guarantees of the League as the basis of a new and lasting political order that would promise equality and security to Jews throughout the world. In Western Europe and the United States, Jews would be protected as equal citizens; in Eastern Europe, millions of Jews would be protected as a national minority, and Palestine would develop as a Jewish national center through the gradual immigration of Jewish pioneers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> Several Jewish organizations were established, first to fight for guarantees for Jewish rights at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, which oversaw the establishment of the League, and then to oversee their successful implementation. Most prominent among these were the American Jewish Congress and the Comit\u00e9 des d\u00e9l\u00e9gations juives (Committee of Jewish Delegations) which functioned, respectively, as representative bodies of Jewish communities in the United States and Eastern Europe. In 1936, to confront the rise of Nazism and the erosion of Jewish rights throughout Eastern Europe, the leadership of these organizations founded the World Jewish Congress (WJC) to serve as a unified political organization and diplomatic arm of the Jewish people. The WJC was led by Stephen S. Wise, a prominent American reform rabbi and Zionist leader, and Nahum Goldman, a German-Jewish Zionist leader. On the eve of the founding assembly of the WJC, Wise and Goldman sought recommendations for a young lawyer interested in Jewish affairs to work at the WJC. Riegner\u2019s professors at the Graduate Institute strongly recommended him.

After World War I, Danzig had been accorded the status of an autonomous \u201cfree city,\u201d with its existence and constitution guaranteed by the Council of the League. Because of its unique political status, tens of thousands of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe passed through and temporarily resided in the city, where they were aided by the local Jewish community as they awaited immigration visas. From 1933 onward, the Nazis had won increasing power and ultimately a majority in the local senate. The Nazis introduced antisemitic legislation and persecuted Jews. In his testimony and memoir, Riegner recalls his efforts to fight to protect Jewish rights in Danzig. The WJC repeatedly advocated for the suspension of anti-Jewish legislation before the High Commissioners appointed to Danzig by the League and in various other League bodies. These efforts did not prove very successful. Riegner notes that the only achievement was to delay the introduction of the \u201cAryan paragraph\u201d in the Danzig bylaws by about a year.  "

        "text": "The second was WJC advocacy on behalf of Jews in Romania. In December 1937, a pro-fascist government was formed in Romania under the leadership of two right-wing leaders, Octavian Goga and Alexander Cuza. This government advocated an alliance with the Third Reich and pursued antisemitic policies modeled after Nazi Germany. The party vowed to establish a regime based on the dominance of the Romanian \u201crace\u201d and to exclude Jews from public life. It pursued a policy aimed at stripping some 250,000-500,000 Jews of their citizenship. After World War I, the League required Romania to grant citizenship and minority rights to hundreds of thousands of Jews from territories newly awarded to Romania in Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania. Successive Romanian governments tried to prevent Jews from acquiring their rightful citizenship, and the Goga-Cuza government sought to annul the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Jews. In his memoir and testimony, Riegner describes the efforts of the WJC to fight these antisemitic policies. In January 1938, Riegner prepared a petition in which the WJC demanded that the League adopt an urgency clause to protect Jews in Romania. In the following weeks, Riegner and other WJC officials met with leaders such as the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yvon Delbos, the British Foreign Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cranborne, and Soviet Ambassador Yakov Suritz, while Stephen Wise obtained a declaration from US President Roosevelt in which he expressed his distaste for the persecution of Jews in East Central Europe. The League rejected the WJC demand to invoke the urgency clause but immediately appointed a Committee of Three charged with dealing with the problems raised by the petition ahead of the next session. Ultimately, pressure from the British and French government led to the resignation of the Goga government in February. Britain and France had substantial foreign policy and economic interests in Romania and they opposed a government aligned with Nazi Germany and the fascist axis. By engaging in public advocacy, the WJC succeeded in drawing sustained international attention to the illegitimacy of the Goga government. Riegner observes in his testimony: \u201cthis was my first, real, great political fight in-- in my career. It was '38. I had joined in '36, in the end of '36. But this was a real, great fight.

Schulte met with Benno Sagalowitz, the press officer of the Swiss Jewish community, and Isidor Koppelmann, a businessman, who subsequently shared this information with Riegner. This information served as the basis of the telegram Riegner sent at the beginning of August to New York and later London.  "

And I want to make it clear that the difference of this report to other reports was that there is a concept, a total plan \u2026 there was a whole concept, that the intention was to kill everybody, to wipe out everybody, this came for the first time in this message.\u201d This report differed markedly from previous reports that informed that \u201cterrible things happen, that Jews were deported, that Jews there killed, that thousands and tens of thousands were dying in the camps and-- and dying in-- in some ghettos. This we knew, that they were killed in the thousands. This we knew \u2026.\u201d As Riegner further explains in his testimony, \u201cwe were faced with the question, is this possible? Is it possible that such a thing is being decided and is being contemplated? Our, uh, Sagalowitz and I, uh, we kept the whole story for ourselves. The greatest, uh, danger was that this is getting into rumors, and then it's not being taken seriously\u2026. our problem is-- was, can one believe it? \u2026 And I struggled with myself for several days, whether one could \u2026 And I came to the conclusion, they are capable of doing it.\u201d  "

        "text": "It is important to emphasize Riegner\u2019s point that the information from Schulte introduced an entirely new concept and thus, even if he believed it accurate, was nonetheless still difficult to comprehend. Other genocides in history involved mass killings of members of a certain group but the Nazi genocide of the Jews was the first instance where the intention was to annihilate all members of a certain group. Other genocides were carried out in a way that, for the most part, served and was consistent with a group\u2019s war objectives. In the Nazi genocide alone, the murder of Jews was carried out even as it impeded the Nazi war effort and diverted necessary resources.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-15\"><a href=\"#fn-15\">15</a></sup> Riegner argues in his testimony that it was his German background and his specific experiences in Germany that made him understand the meaning of these reports. \u201cNow, here my German background probably was very decisive. I knew they were capable. I knew their brutality. I knew their lack of mor-- moral principles, their have complete recklessness, their-- this determination to-- to-- to-- to-- to-- to finish with the Jews wherever they could.\u201d \u201cI did not only remember Mein Kampf. I remembered, several, very clear statements by Hitler and by Goehring ...whatever will happen, uh, this-- in this war, one thing is certain. This will be the end of Germ-- of European Jewry. And he said it.\u201d Riegner connected this report with other reports he had received about Jews being rounded up for deportation across Europe and concluded that the Nazis were now in the process of \u201cthe implementation of a total extermination.\u201d  "

        "text": "As Riegner notes in his testimony, when his reports first arrived in New York and London they were met with disbelief. Part of the disbelief, he acknowledges, was related to anti-Jewish sentiment. The British and US governments strictly limited immigration of Jewish refugees and feared that these policies would be further challenged if news of the extermination became widespread. British and US officials also opposed creating the impression that the war was fought for the Jews \u2013 either because of their own anti-Jewish prejudices or because they wanted to cater to the prejudices of others. Part of the disbelief, Riegner argues, was also a result of legitimate questions about the credibility of the news. As Riegner observes in his testimony, when British officials first learned about the news \u201cthey were puzzled, who is Riegner?\u201d \u2013 was his information reliable? But above all, Riegner suggests, their failure to believe the news was because, \u201cin reality, this went beyond human understanding. This is a real-- the only explanation.\u201d Only after several additional reports and confirmations arrived in London and New York, did the Allied governments issue, on December 17th 1942, a declaration stating that Nazi Germany was carrying out a plan of mass extermination of European Jewry. But even after the declaration, Riegner argues, the full meaning and implications of the extermination had not registered in the Allied capitals. Indeed, from late 1942 the press in the Allied capitals regularly published news of massacres of Jews in Europe. Some observers regarded these reports as exaggerated and inaccurate while many became desensitized to them through the sheer volume of horror. As the London based <em>Jewish Standard</em> put it, \u201cJewish slaughter became an every day affair and the senses of non-Jews were dulled into indifference.\u201d \u201cThe whole thing is so starkly tragic,\u201d wrote Harold Ickes, British Secretary of the Interior, in response to a report on massacres of Jews in Poland, \u201cthat it saturates the imagination.\u201d One Jewish observes spoke about the \u201cfeverish competition\u201d between Jewish bodies \u201ceach seeking to anticipate the other\u201d by publishing \u201cstill newer and larger horrors.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-16\"><a href=\"#fn-16\">16</a></sup> "

        "text": "Even among Jewish leaders privy to this knowledge there remained a wide conceptual gap between knowing that extermination was taking place and understanding its meaning and implications. During the war, WJC leaders planned for the future of Jews in Europe after the war. Many WJC leaders, including Goldman, planned to demand new guarantees for minority rights for Jews in postwar Eastern Europe. In June 1943, Jacob Robinson, head of the postwar planning institute of the WJC, lambasted Goldman and other WJC leaders for embracing this vision. After the war, \u201cthe number of Jews left in Europe after the war ... will be so small,\u201d he argued, that any political program aimed at securing collective rights for a sizeable Jewish minority in Eastern Europe was disconnected from reality. Similarly, Richard Lichtheim, head of the Jewish Agency office in Geneva, who worked closely with Riegner during the war, argued in September 1942 that Zionist leaders did not comprehend the news of the extermination. In May 1942, Zionist leaders espoused a plan for the mass immigration of millions of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe to Palestine after the war. But Lichtheim argued that too few Jews would survive to justify a mass immigration plan to Palestine.\u201d The vast extent of the Jewish catastrophe, he declared, meant that the \u201cbasis of Zionism as it was understood and preached during the last 50 years has gone.\u201d \u201cWhatever number of Jews will be after this war ... there will be no need for [a] mass emigration\u201d of Jews to Palestine. Both Robinson and Lichtheim continued to advance these argument throughout the war, insisting that Jewish leaders \u2013 even as they learned about the extermination \u2013 had not adjusted their political thinking to the new postwar reality it entailed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-17\"><a href=\"#fn-17\">17</a></sup> "
