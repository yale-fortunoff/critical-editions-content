Over a single generation, more than a quarter of the Jewish-Russian population was resettled overseas... The Russian Empire was home to some 5.3 million Jews in 1897, approximately half of world Jewry. Almost all of them, 94 percent, were residing in a restricted territory known as the Pale of Settlement, comprising the 25 western provinces of the Russian Empire... Under the Tsars, the Jewish population experienced a very rapid population growth, according to estimates as much as five-fold during the nineteenth century.. The 1881 crisis that followed the assassination of the relatively liberal-minded Tsar Alexander II, and the ascendance to the throne of his reactionary son Tsar Alexander III, is often considered a \"turning point\" in Jewish History..

Languages had long been part of Anglo-American university education\u2014classical languages predominated until the nineteenth century, with the shift toward modern languages growing more pronounced in the twentieth century. Still, relatively few students at Yale majored in a language in the 1930s. Bruskin's European-born parents had realized the importance of languages. This was common among European Jews\u2014the belief that persecution was always a possibility and that languages helped provide an escape route. Cultural critic George Steiner, who was born in Paris in 1929 to Viennese emigres, recalled how his father moved the family from Austria to France to escape the growing threat of antisemitism. He believed that Jews were \"endangered guests wherever they went\" and ensured that his children learned languages: Steiner grew up with three mother tongues: German, English, and French. Steiner's  mother was multilingual and would often \"begin a sentence in one language and end it in another.\"<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-25\"><a href=\"#fn-25\">25</a></sup> Sidney Bruskin, although not matching George Steiner in ability, developed language skills that would be instrumental in his wartime service."

It remains an unanswered question why he did not know how to cycle: he was not too poor to obtain a used one. While he was a good student, he was not overly cerebral (he was on the wrestling team). Perhaps New Haven was too urban? At that time, the city was more compact and it was possible to travel most places by foot. Regardless, Bruskin ended up with a bicycle business. He recalls that because there were no teaching jobs available in the USA when he graduated from Yale, he looked to go abroad and teach. On the train back from New York, where he had visited teacher agencies, he met a man in the bike business who suggested he start his own rental shop. Sidney managed to obtain $110 from an insurance policy his father had taken out when he was a year old, and that allowed him to buy \"dozens of used bicycles\" and start his business.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-26\"><a href=\"#fn-26\">26</a></sup> He opened his shop on 4 April 1937 (on a bitterly cold day when no one wanted to rent a bike), but he persevered and expanded operations to include repairs. The Bicycle Shopremained a fixture for a long time in downtown New Haven. It was located in the Oak Street District, where Italian- and Jewish-Americans predominated.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-27\"><a href=\"#fn-27\">27</a></sup> Bruskin's shop was located at 1129 Oak Street, which is near the corner of York Avenue. The building in which the shop was located was torn down in 1961 and replaced by Paul Rudolph's famous and controversial Yale School of Architecture building.

Bodies that one would never have believed could exist alive were walking around, covered with sores and lice. The filth was indescribable. Adjacent to the crematorium were rooms piled high with shrunken nude bodies, lye thrown over them to combat the stench and vermin. The excess bodies that couldn't be handled at the crematorium were hauled by the wagonload to another part of the enclosure, where they were dumped into open pits filled with a chemical solution. Worse still was the hospital, where the dying and sick had been herded for experimentation before being carted off to the crematorium. There were no beds in it; the inmates lay on shelves covered with dirty rags, groups of two or three huddled together like mice to keep warm. As we entered they put out their hands and begged for food. When we told them we had none, but that the American medics and military government personnel would be along immediately, they broke down and sobbed, \"We have waited for you four, five, six years.
