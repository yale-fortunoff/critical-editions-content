The Americans then radioed back to their headquarters what they had discovered. One prisoner who spoke English, Max Garcia, directed the American troops to the stacks of bodies near the crematorium. After evaluating the situation, the Americans reported that 300 prisoners were dying of starvation every day. They requisitioned local food and made soup for the prisoners, but some died from 'refeeding syndrome' (not being able to handle solid food after a long period of privation).

Part of the Mauthausen extermination system built up by Kaltenbrunner when he had been the 'Little Himmler' of Austria, it seemed more horrible even than Dachau or Ohrdruf. Bodies that one would never have believed could exist alive were walking around, covered with sores and lice. The filth was indescribable. Adjacent to the crematorium were rooms piled high with shrunken nude bodies, lye thrown over them to combat the stench and vermin. The excess bodies that couldn't be handled at the crematorium were hauled by the wagonload to another part of the enclosure, where they were dumped into open pits filled with a chemical solution. Worse still was the hospital, where the dying and sick had been herded for experimentation before being carted off to the crematorium. There were no beds in it; the inmates lay on shelves covered with dirty rags, groups of two or three huddled together like mice to keep warm. As we entered they put out their hands and begged for food. When we told them we had none, but that the American medics and military government personnel would be along immediately, they broke down and sobbed, \"We have waited for you four, five, six years.
