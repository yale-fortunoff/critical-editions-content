The newly founded Camp of National Unity (Ob\u00f3z Zjednoczenia Narodowego, OZN) adopted some of the National Democrats\u2019 nationalistic and antisemitic catchphrases. The state ideology was morphing into an authoritarianism that advocated waging an economic war against the Jews and their exclusion from public and economic life. Polish national radicals further demanded segregation of Jewish students, first demanding \u201cvoluntary\u201d separation and, when this was refused, violently attacking Jewish students. In 1937-8 most Polish universities introduced segregation (so-called \u201cghetto benches\u201d). By 1939 many Polish institutes of higher learning had implemented a <em>numerus clausus</em> system that reduced the number of Jewish students.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> "

Balicka mentions blackmailers (szmalcownicy) only once, but they appear in many other testimonies. Jews were blackmailed when they did not wear a compulsory band with the Star of David and when leaving the ghetto. In 1941 the Germans introduced the death penalty for Jews in hiding and those who helped them. The blackmailers extorted money and valuables from Jews and from Poles helping them. This practice became more widespread after the \u201cGreat Action\u201d in the summer of 1942, when numerous Jews attempted to survive among Poles on the Aryan side of Warsaw. The scale of blackmailing is difficult to assess but there is no doubt that its influence was significant. Many Jews were afraid to leave the ghetto even when they still had the possibility of doing so. Many Poles refused to help.  "

        "text": "But this help had some limitations too. The narrative of Helena Balicka Koz\u0142owska sheds important light on interactions between Jews and Poles in occupied Warsaw. She mentions that apart from people who were deeply assimilated before the war she had hitherto known almost nobody from a traditional Jewish community. Poles and traditional Jews lived in one country, but in social and cultural separation. Close and friendly relations between them were rare. The only girl from a traditional Jewish family whom Balicka knew was Sarah Biderman. Balicka met her shortly before the war and visited her a few times in the ghetto before summer 1942.  "

A few months later, Balicka received a letter from Sarah informing her that she had survived the summer deportations. They met secretly at the Czerniak\u00f3w Farm, which belonged to the Polish landlord Wojciech Zatwarnicki, who employed young Jews from the Dror \u2013 one of the Zionists organizations. They lived and worked there for food and salaries. It was also a secret base of The Jewish Fighting Organization.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\">11</a></sup> Only then did she find out that Sarah was not only a member of the Zionist movement but had also joined the Jewish underground. Sarah explained to her that she had tried to get out of the ghetto but failed. Balicka realized then what Jews faced when attempting to leave the ghetto. It was not only a wall or a pointed weapon; the ghetto was a bad accent, cultural alienation, and a lack of friendly outside contacts. Traditional Polish Jews could not simply loose themselves in a street crowd. Their strangeness was visible and made them vulnerable. This confession is moving: \u201c I did realize something that I should have known earlier, what I had known theoretically, but only then did it get to me. The isolation of the Jews from Polish society [\u2026]. Only then, in Czerniak\u00f3w, did I understand the meaning of the isolation of those two communities that had supposedly lived next to each other for a thousand years.\u201d  "
