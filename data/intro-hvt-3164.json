In 1941 the Germans introduced the death penalty for Jews in hiding and those who helped them. The blackmailers extorted money and valuables from Jews and from Poles helping them. This practice became more widespread after the “Great Action” in the summer of 1942, when numerous Jews attempted to survive among Poles on the Aryan side of Warsaw.
