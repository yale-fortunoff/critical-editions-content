I eventually selected an interview by Norbert Nadler, a man of Lebzelter's age who lived under circumstances close to Lebzelter. Like her, Nadler survived life in the ghetto with family members but without a sweetheart, partner, or children. He was a native German-speaker, middle-class, from a solidly-rooted Czernowitz family, all characteristics of Lebzelter. As she did, Nadler moved to Romania after the war and emigrated in the early 1960s. It is this man's testimony that I use as a framework and his narrative whose thread I follow below.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-11\"><a href=\"#fn-11\">11</a></sup> I begin each thematic section with an excerpt from Nadler's interview and a second quote from another testimonial source; the quotes are followed by contextualization."

Serving as a sort of handbook with a masterful collection of literary texts alongside historical analysis is Cecile Cordon and Helmut Kusdat, eds., <em>An der Zeiten R\u00e4nder. Czernowitz und die Bukowina. Geschichte. Literatur. Verfolgung. Exil.</em> (Vienna: Theodor Kramer Gesellschaft, 2002). Numerous memoirs exist, many in German, these are often cited below. For example, Zvi Yavetz, <em>Erinnerungen an Czernowitz. Wo Menschen und B\u00fcchter lebten</em> (Munich: C.H. Beck, 2008). In the last few decades a spate of collected oral history publications have been released, including Gaby Coldewey et al., eds, <em>\"Czernowitz is gewen an alte, jidische Schtot\u2026\": J\u00fcdische \u00dcberlebende berichten</em> (Berlin: Heinrich-B\u00f6ll Stiftung, 1999) and its later, companion volume Gaby Coldewey et al. eds., <em>Zwischen Pruth und Jordan: Lebenserinnerungen Czernowitzer Juden</em> (K\u00f6ln: B\u00f6hlau Verlag, 2003. The editors suggest that it is the specific biographical framework of the interviewees \u2013 torn from Czernowitz at the zenith of their youth \u2013 that resulted in the mythologization of time and place. They write \"independent of whether the paradise of [ethnic] cohabitation and sophisticated German-Austrian cultural life ever truly existed, it lives on as an imagined space in the thoughts, memories, and black and white photographs of those we interviewed.\" Beyond the nostalgic memories, an underlying tension is acknowledged by and through the interviewees, suggesting that \"it is this space of tension between mythology and its covert dismantling in which Czernowitz is actually to be found. And the simple realization, acknowledged with a wink, is: Czernowitz can be found, where Czernowitzers are.\" Gaby Coldewey et al, eds., <em>Zwischen Pruth und Jordan: Lebenserinnerungen Czernowitzer Juden</em> (K\u00f6ln: B\u00f6hlau Verlag, 2003), xii.

However, in 1941, following Operation Barbarossa, Romania retook both Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia. By 1945 these regions were reconquered by the Red Army; northern Bukovina became part of the Ukraine Soviet Socialist Republic and Bessarabia became again the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1991 the latter became the Republic of Moldova. The state of the Republic of Moldova is not to be confused with the Romanian region of Moldova, in the eastern part of Romania.</p>"

The ghetto was then disbanded. Fichman, <em>Memories</em>, 80-81. Dr. Train Popovici was later recognized by Yad Vashem as a righteous gentile. In the end, however, the authorizations were not equal. In June of 1942 those with Popovici authorizations were collected and deported to Transnistria. Silbermann writes that neither could a Calotescu permit always guarantee safety: \" If there was any bit of air left to breathe in the train cars, then families with a valid Calotescu authorization, upon whose homes Romanian neighbors had cast an eye, were also herded in.

The exact numbers of the dead are disputed and difficult to verify completely. I use the figures quoted by Deletant: he cites 147,000 Jews deported from Bukovina and Bessarabia, out of which 90,000 perished (57,000 survived). In addition, an estimated 130,00-170,000 local Ukrainian Jews were killed or died of starvation and disease. Deletant, \"Transnistria,\" in <em>Shoah in Ukraine</em>, 157 and footnotes 4 and 5. Numbers for Transnistria in general are also complex. Hilberg's figures differ somewhat: he estimates that of 160,000 deported from Bukovina and Bessarabia, approximately 51,000 were alive (109,000 dead) in September 1943. Hilberg, <em>Destruction of the European Jews</em>, 847-848. Precise figures aside, experts generally agree that more or less 1/3 of the deportees survived.</p>"

Nevertheless, even if one assumes a generous multiplication factor \u2013 i.e., that the foundry saved between four to five times above the number of 600 official workers, this amounts to between 2,000-3,000 lives. In a ghetto of around 15,000 people, this is a significant fraction of the population, yet hardly a majority. Moreover, those employed were more likely to be educated, technically trained, or with personal connections to the well-off leadership, that is, they were already of the privileged class. What of the less fortunate? Indeed, as Nadler's and other testimonies reveal, there was stark social stratification within the ghetto. Nadler elaborated on this point, \"Because the Jews have just right [a]way been divided. The Jews from the occupied territory, from-- from Moghilev, they were the worst. The Jews from Bessarabia, they were the second worst. And we, from the Bukovina, which came in, we were considered a little bit better.\""

Those who had never experienced life under communism arrived better off financially. With both valuables and hard cash, they were in a position to offer attractive bribes.
