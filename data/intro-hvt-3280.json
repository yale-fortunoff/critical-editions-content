In some senses, they are the most “Soviet” of Soviet Jews. Nevertheless, many of this generation retained a substantive Jewish identity that wasn’t necessarily defined by the Holocaust, by late-Stalinist antisemitism, or by Soviet anti-Zionism. Instead, their Jewishness was primarily rooted in familial and hometown bonds, which continued to shape their lives long after the catastrophic Nazi occupation of 1941-1944.

As a child, Liubov’s daily life was profoundly shaped by Soviet modernization projects. Although her father was an artisan, not a peasant, Soviet farm collectivization and the resulting food shortages had a deep impact on her family. During the Holodomor famine of 1932-1933, many families, Jewish and Ukrainian alike, decided to hand over their children to state orphanages until they could provide for them again. As Liubov’ recalls, “…the director of our school took me and my two brothers into the orphanage, and we stayed there until I finished seventh grade. Then I returned home.” The school that Liubov’ attended through the ninth grade was one of over 800 secular Yiddish-language schools in Soviet Ukraine.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> These schools, along with other Soviet minority-language schools, were designed to supplant religious educational institutions and educate Soviet youth in socialist values.

In her testimony, Liubov’ recalls accompanying her parents to synagogue, celebrating religious Jewish holidays, and learning traditional prayers from her uncle. Other, non-religious aspects of traditional shtetl life also lingered, including economic and social patterns that had existed for centuries. For example, most Jews in Zvenigorodka, including Liubov’s father, maintained their traditional artisanal trades as cobblers, tailors, tinsmiths, etc. In an effort to build a socialist economy, the Soviet state drove the collectivization of such artisans into “artels.” However, within the highly concentrated Jewish population of the former Pale of Settlement, these artels reinforced Jewish social circles and, by extension, traditional Jewish life. Furthermore, in its effort to rally popular support for the development of a socialist economy, the Soviet state pursued a policy of “indigenization” in the 1920s, producing popular culture that was “national in form, socialist in content.” Yiddish language theater troupes and newspapers promulgated a linguistic and cultural Jewishness that appealed to secular and religious Jews alike. These cultural institutions, like the Yiddish schools, were largely shuttered in the mid-late 1930s as the Stalinist state asserted a more homogeneous Soviet culture. Nevertheless, their brief existence produced a generation of Soviet Jews whose Jewish identity was substantively Jewish and profoundly Soviet. Far from forced assimilation, Soviet modernization in provincial Ukraine reinforced Jewish identities and communities, even as these identities and communities assumed a distinctly Soviet flavor.  "}},{"id":"IS9ReRb_Jk","type":"paragraph","data":{"paragraphType":"paragraph","text":"As much as Liubov’s testimony complicates familiar narratives of Soviet Jews’ wholesale assimilation, it also challenges common assumptions regarding the creation of the “Final Solution” and familiar narratives regarding Jewish-Ukrainian relations during the German occupation. After the German Wehrmacht launched its invasion into Soviet territory on June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany rapidly seized control of vast new territories inhabited by populations it deemed racially inferior—Slavs, Roma, and above all, Jews. In the initial months of the occupation, German operatives focused on eliminating potential sources of resistance, particularly Communist party officials and other “radical” elements. While Nazi propaganda frequently employed the words “communist” and “Jew” interchangeably, there was no policy yet for the annihilation of Jews. Instead, the German occupiers initially confined Jews to ghettos in or near their hometowns. According to Christopher Browning, between September 18 and October 25, 1941, the Third Reich developed a comprehensive vision for the Final Solution, which was later codified at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> This new vision called for the construction of industrialized extermination centers in Poland to which Jews would be deported from across Europe. Yet, even as this official policy was still being formulated, mass killing had already begun in the occupied Soviet territories. As Browning argues, the shift toward mass murder in the East was not initiated by a direct order from Berlin, but instead by local German commanders, as a matter of administrative practicality.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup> Thus, in September 1941, German Einsatzgruppen and police, with the assistance of local collaborators, began to conduct mass shootings in which hundreds, sometimes thousands of Jews were murdered in ravines and forests near their hometowns. After a reprieve during the winter of 1941-1942, mass shootings resumed as ghettos were liquidated throughout 1942 and early 1943.

But he didn’t take that into consideration.” For local collaborators like Grisha, the knowledge of their victims as human beings was glaring, and yet they chose to murder nonetheless. How was this possible? For some, it appears that careerist ambition prompted collaboration. However, in Grisha’s case, anti-Soviet sentiments seem to have played a decisive role. Just before killing Liubov’s mother, he bursts out, “You [Jews] tortured us for 23 years”—thereby attributing the oppression he and his family had apparently suffered under Soviet rule to the Jews collectively and, specifically, to a helpless Jewish woman whom he had known for years as a neighbor.

On the continuum between anti-Jewish violence and anti-Nazi resistance, non-Jews across occupied Europe exhibited a broad range of morally ambiguous reactions to the German persecution of Jews. For example, Liubov’ describes the economic opportunism of some local Zvenigorodka residents following the ghettoization of their former Jewish neighbors. Desperate to supplement meager food rations, Jews were forced to sell off their household possessions. The “buyers” were local non-Jews who illegally snuck into the ghetto in order to capitalize on desperation. According to Liubov,’ many of the “buyers” promised to bring money or food in exchange for the furniture they took, but few returned with the promised payment. Such transactions did occasionally provide Jews with extra sustenance and, technically, transactions between Jews and non-Jews defied German regulations. Thus, it is difficult to classify these interactions as simple collaboration.

Knowing they might be recognized and betrayed if they returned to their hometowns of Zvenigorodka and Ol’shana, the two young women fled south – entrusting their fate to the kindness of strangers. At the border of the Kiev and Kirovograd Provinces, they met Yarina, a woman from the village of Kozachany who took them in. Liubov’ and Raya initially impersonated Ukrainian workers who had escaped from labor conscription in Germany. After Yarina overheard Liubov’ speaking Yiddish in her sleep though, she confronted the two women.

She relates the story of Etinzon, an inmate in the first Nemorozh camp. On November 2, 1942, he managed to escape the camp’s first liquidation. Suddenly a fugitive, he sought shelter in a nearby peasant hut. The woman there provided him a generous meal, but when she stepped out under the pretext of going to visit a neighbor, he grew suspicious and left the premises immediately. Etinzon’s instincts proved correct as the peasant woman had gone to fetch a politsai member, who no doubt would have shot Etinzon on the spot.

Liubov’s identification of Ukrainian collaborators and grateful acknowledgement of Ukrainian aid-givers makes her testimony a particularly valuable record of the complexity of inter-ethnic and inter-religious relations during the German occupation.

In many locales, elderly adults and young children fell victim to mass shootings early in the German occupation. Surviving adults were condemned to forced labor in the ghettoes or in small labor camps, living in constant fear of the ongoing mass shootings. This history of forced labor in occupied Soviet territory is one of the more under-researched aspects of the Holocaust. Liubov’s testimony recounts the experience of grueling labor, appalling living conditions, and the constant threat of death.

After the Second World War, many of the conditions that had allowed for the flowering of a Jewish-Soviet public identity during the 1920s and 30s evaporated – both as a result of the Nazi genocide and due to rapid postwar changes in Soviet society. After the war, the Soviet state viewed its citizens who had survived under occupation, even Jews, with deep suspicion. Furthermore, due to the hardening of Soviet anti-Zionism after the creation of the State of Israel, the Soviet state increasingly viewed its Jewish citizens as an untrustworthy, foreign element. Unofficially, Soviet educational institutions and employers began to discriminate against Jews, denying them access to the types of social mobility they had enjoyed in the 1920s and 30s. The shuttering of the few remaining secular Jewish institutions in the late 1940s compounded the devastation that the Nazi occupation had exacted on Jewish cultural and communal life.

Having experienced a time when it was possible to be both Jewish and Soviet, they maintained a dual self-image as Jewish and fully Soviet, doggedly navigating Soviet society to the best of their abilities despite growing discrimination. In contrast, younger Soviet Jews, who came of age after the war, had few positive memories of being Jewish and experienced their Jewishness primarily as a source of shame. Some later rebelled against this stigma by embracing Zionism and fighting for the right to emigrate. However, a more common tendency among both the older and the younger generation was to confine their Jewishness to the private sphere – to the family and the home, or even to the secrecy of their personal memories.
