Her observant Jewish family belonged to the upper-middle class \u2013 her father Friedrich Kummermann was a successful textile merchant. Martha was well educated, and an entrepreneur herself. In 1931 she married Hrand Saraffian, an Armenian Christian refugee from Constantinople, with whom she had two daughters, Noemi and Hanna. Despite her civil marriage to a Protestant, Martha Saraffian remained a member of the Jewish community and their first daughter, Noemi, was raised as Jewish. After the annexation the Saraffian family was discriminated against, persecuted for their \u201cmixed marriage.\u201d<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></sup> Martha Saraffian was eventually deported to the Ghetto Theresienstadt/Terez\u00edn in 1945 and her husband interned in several forced labor camps. While many of Martha\u2019s family members perished in the Holocaust, including her mother who was murdered near Lublin, the couple and their children survived in occupied Czechia. After liberation, they emigrated to Argentina and later, in the 1960s, after Hrand had passed away, to New York City, where Martha lived until December 2006.  "

First, it is one of the few first-generation testimonies in the Fortunoff Archive of a Jew surviving the Holocaust in a mixed marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> Indeed, her testimony concerns the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, where conditions for such families were in many respects even worse than in many areas of the Reich proper. Second, she was married to a survivor of the Armenian massacres in Ottoman Turkey, a stateless refugee, who was nonetheless considered \u201cAryan\u201d under the Nuremberg Race Laws. For Hrand Saraffian, the Holocaust was the second major experience of persecution in his life. This intersection of the history of the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust in the lives of one family is certainly unique. Their experiences during the Holocaust are nevertheless representative of the fate of many Czech and Sudeten-German mixed marriages. Martha Saraffian\u2019s testimony revolves primarily around her experience as an \u201cintermarried\u201d Jew, the fate of her children, persecuted as Jewish \u201c<em>Mischlinge</em>,\u201d of her husband\u2019s slave labor, as well as her own experience as a forced laborer in Prague and later in Theresienstadt ghetto. In the end, hers is also a story of seeking justice.  "

By this date she had lived in the United States for 21 years,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\">5</a></sup> having lived for about 15 years previously in Argentina, where the family emigrated to after the war. While her command of English was certainly not bad, it lacked the fluency of her native German tongue, and was perhaps her fourth or fifth language. While some parts of the testimony are rich in detail, others lack \u201cthick description\u201d and levels of detail. Strikingly, none of the members of her family \u2013 neither her husband, her children,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\">6</a></sup> nor her parents \u2013 are mentioned by name in the testimony. However, when Saraffian did mention names of persons and places or specific events she demonstrated an extraordinary memory, only occasionally confusing places and dates. This accuracy of her testimony has allowed for the reconstruction of some of the \u201cgaps\u201d in her narration and the finding of further documents. As stated, her marriage to a non-Jew, an Armenian refugee, and the complicated status of her children \u2013 one was a member of the Jewish community, the other was not \u2013 were important aspects of her life story, of her experience. These were the aspects she wanted to start her testimony with and to which she continuously returned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-7\"><a href=\"#fn-7\">7</a></sup> However, she was frequently interrupted by the interviewers, who were apparently pushing for a more chronological and \u201cscenic\u201d narration.

This crown land, one part of the historic Czech lands, which had received a certain degree of autonomy after the Austrian-Hungarian compromise of 1867, was the major site of an ongoing national conflict between Austrian Czechs and Austrian Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> The Czechs, who were the majority in Bohemia, had strived for national autonomy or even independence for decades. Most Germans in the region fiercely opposed any such initiative. Bohemia was therefore an epicenter of both German and Czech nationalism and radicalization. It is thus not surprising that in 1903 the German Workers\u2019 Party, an early forerunner of the Austrian and German-Czech National Socialist movement, was founded in the heavily industrialized region. Bohemian Jews were caught in the middle of this national struggle between Czechs and Germans, which also extended to other regions of the monarchy, such as Moravia and even Vienna.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-13\"><a href=\"#fn-13\">13</a></sup> In the 18th and 19th centuries the majority of Bohemian Jews had identified as Germans, at least on paper, as the Austro-Hungarian system of nationality was based on self-identification and the self-declared everyday language of its citizens.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-14\"><a href=\"#fn-14\">14</a></sup> Hence these national identities were always fluid and never cemented. Identifications began to shift towards the Czech side at the turn of the century, especially in the Czech majority areas, and a vocal minority of Bohemian Jews also supported Zionism. However, many citizens of the region, whether Jewish or not, were in the truest sense \u201cmulticultural\u201d and bilingual, at least to some degree, and shifting identifications were also a matter of political allegiances. According to the 1910 census, 62.66% of the inhabitants of Bohemia spoke Czech (including Slovakian) as their daily common language, whereas 36.45% were German speakers (in Austria-Hungary as a whole 23.36% were German speakers, 19.57% Hungarian speakers and 12.54% spoke Czech and Slovakian, the rest other languages). Jews accounted for only 1.5% of the entire Bohemian population at the time. However, in Prague, Jews accounted for a large part, perhaps even the majority, of the city\u2019s German population.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-15\"><a href=\"#fn-15\">15</a></sup> "

Many Germans, especially in the Bohemian periphery and in Moravia, agitated either for reunification with Austria or, increasingly, for the annexation of the borderlands by Germany. These voices grew continuously louder after 1933. Jewish citizens, even if they identified culturally as Germans, were mostly loyal to the new Czechoslovakian Republic, which was religiously tolerant and curbed antisemitism for the longest time.  "

The historic city of Trautenau is located at the river Aupe/\u00dapa, a tributary of the Elbe/Labe, in the south-eastern foothills of the Sudeten/Sudety, a large mountain range between Bohemia and Silesia, today roughly along the border between Czechia and Poland.

German separatists began to refer to these regions, which did not form a political unity until the Nazi annexation in October 1938, as <em>Sudetenland</em>, the land of the Sudeten-Germans. While these areas were not granted any form of autonomy by the Czechoslovakian state, German was still used as an official administrative and educational language. In her testimony, Saraffian refers to this linguistic and political change in meaning: \u201cAnd we moved to the Sudeten. At this time, it was Austria. It was not Sudeten.\u201d Despite the political changes after World War I, Trautenau remained an almost entirely German-speaking town with around 13,000 inhabitants.  "

In 1910, the town\u2019s Jewish population peaked at 478 persons and then slowly declined in the interwar period. The small Jewish community (at any given point less than around four percent of the population) was well integrated into the civic society and social fabric of the town, and played an important role in the linen industry, which was the strongest industrial and commercial sector of Trautenau.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-20\"><a href=\"#fn-20\">20</a></sup> "

His father, Emanuel Kummermann, born in the mid-1830s, was a merchant in Humpoletz.

Independent Czechoslovakia had adopted, by and large, the Imperial Austrian system of national self-identification based on everyday language. However, for the 1921 census the authorities also introduced the option of \u201cJewish\u201d as a national affiliation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-35\"><a href=\"#fn-35\">35</a></sup> German and Hungarian nationalists decried this as an attempt to weaken Jewish affiliation with their respective minorities. In 1921, under 15 percent of Bohemian Jews identified as \u201cnational Jews\u201d \u2013 the others as Czechs or Germans. In total, however, about half of the 354,000 Czechoslovakian Jews made this identification; in the East, Carpatho-Ukraine and Slovakia, it was over 90 percent. By the late 1920s the numbers of \u201cnational Jews\u201d increased in Bohemia, with around 20 percent declaring Jewish nationality, 50 percent Czech and 30 percent German.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-36\"><a href=\"#fn-36\">36</a></sup> According to J\u00f6rg Osterloh\u2019s estimate, about 30 percent of Jews in the later Reich District Sudetenland, which included Trautenau, identified as national Jews in the early 1930s and most of the others as Germans and some as Czechs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-37\"><a href=\"#fn-37\">37</a></sup> The exact numbers for Trautenau were 13.35 percent in 1921 and 19.23 in 1930; the other Jews identified as Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-38\"><a href=\"#fn-38\">38</a></sup> In 1921, the entire Kummermann family declared German nationality and Jewish religion.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-39\"><a href=\"#fn-39\">39</a></sup> This is perhaps not surprising in a then almost exclusively German-speaking town, where even the bilingual Czech-German Czechoslovakian census forms were filled out entirely in German. As Wolf Gruner convincingly argues, in the mid-1930s the situation of German-speaking Jews in Czechoslovakia became increasingly precarious. On the one hand radical antisemitism was rapidly increasing, foremost among the Sudeten-Germans, on the other hand, Czech nationalists labelled them national traitors, siding with the Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-40\"><a href=\"#fn-40\">40</a></sup> "

The newspaper reported a 16-year old Turkish servant from Constantinople, by the name of \u201cRhand Sarafian,\u201d who was the victim of sexual harassment by a known offender when he stayed overnight in Wels during a journey.

Nevertheless, he characterizes it as a tightknit community, with many institutions, clubs, and a vibrant social life. Conversions were relatively uncommon in Trautenau. Intermarriage rates, however, were high throughout Czechoslovakia towards the 1930s (around 30 percent of all marriages involving a Jewish spouse). Martha\u2019s parents were apparently deeply unhappy with their daughter\u2019s choice for a life partner. It may have been a small comfort that she did not convert to Christianity, as the Czechoslovakian marriage law allowed for interreligious civil marriages. For Martha Saraffian this rift with her parents was quite painful, as we learn from the testimony.

They felt safe in Czechoslovakia for the longest time and most made no preparations for emigration. Things began to change slightly in the mid-1930s, when more and more German-Jewish refugees arrived in Czechoslovakia and reports of the Nazi persecution of Jews and political enemies circulated widely. At the same time, domestic antisemitism was also on the rise \u2013 both among the Sudeten-Germans and the Czech majority. Nevertheless, until early 1938 the threat posed by Nazism seemed far away. With the annexation of Austria, Czechoslovakia was suddenly encroached upon by Nazi Germany from the north, west, and south \u2013 and the situation became more threatening.  "

The occupation of Czechia meant that the Nazis gained control over about 118,000 Jews,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-56\"><a href=\"#fn-56\">56</a></sup> among them many who had fled from the Sudetenland just months or weeks earlier.

We do not know if Hrand and Martha Saraffian contemplated emigration or even tried to acquire the necessary documents. By any means, it would have been very hard by this point in time. Unlike many German and Austrian Jews, Czechoslovakian Jewry was caught mostly by surprise by the events of September/October 1938 and the full annexation in March 1939. Suddenly surrounded by Nazi Germany and its Slovak Ally and the immediate outbreak of the war against Poland in the summer, there was nowhere in the vicinity left to flee. Obtaining emigration visas had already become increasingly hard by mid-1939.

At the end of December 1938, Hitler had decided that, under certain conditions, he would spare intermarried Jews from forcible resettlement to so-called Jewish living areas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-60\"><a href=\"#fn-60\">60</a></sup> These exemptions \u2013 foremost for families in which the husband and the children were non-Jewish \u2013 were the first steps in what would evolve into the precarious statuses of a merely \u201cprotected\u201d and of a \u201cprivileged\u201d mixed marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-61\"><a href=\"#fn-61\">61</a></sup> The latter were granted further exemptions, depending on gender constellations and children. Following this initial decision, most antisemitic regulations contained special clauses for mixed marriages. One such exemption was implemented in the police decree mandating the visual marking of Jews through a patch. From September 1941 onwards, all Jews in the Reich and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were forced to wear this patch on their clothes, visibly identifying them as Jews.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-62\"><a href=\"#fn-62\">62</a></sup> Paragraph 3 of the police degree ordering the mandatory identification contained an exemption clause for Jews in mixed marriages, if they had children raised as non-Jews, and for Jewish women who were married to non-Jews; not, however, for Jewish men married to non-Jewish women without children. Such exemption clauses prompted mixed families to hope that they would be spared from deportations and eventually even regain their rights.

His decision was announced on September 29, 1941. In breaking with policy in Germany properand Austria, Jewish spouses in such marriages were to be treated just as all other Jews. This decision was reversed by the authorities in Berlin in October of the same year, when it was decided that, for the Protectorate\u2019s German-Jewish marriages the exemptions would still apply, but not, however, for Czech-Jewish marriages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-64\"><a href=\"#fn-64\">64</a></sup> From this point onwards two different types of mixed marriages existed in the Protectorate. Essentially all Czech-Jewish marriages were robbed of their \u201cprivileges\u201d and became merely \u201cprotected\u201d. It is not clear how the Saraffian family was categorized in this respect, given their non-German citizenship and their statelessness. It should be noted that the relevant parts of the Nuremberg laws defining Jews and non-Jews did not differentiate based on citizenship but operated with the terms Jewish and \u201cof German and related blood\u201d. A person without German citizenship could thus still be \u201cof German and related blood\u201d and the marriage would still be considered \u201cmixed\u201d and protected. In fact, the German census contained information on intermarriages, with Germans and stateless persons in one category, and persons with foreign citizenships in the other. However, most exemptions and so-called \u201cprivileges\u201d granted for mixed marriages only applied when there were no children raised as Jews. For example, the exemption from wearing the yellow star stated that the children must have been registered as non-Jews. In the Saraffian\u2019s case, Noemi had been registered as Jewish, as her Trautenau citizen registration clearly shows, making her a \u201c<em>Geltungsj\u00fcdin</em>,\u201d a <em>Mischling</em> who was \u201cdeemed Jewish.\u201d So even if the Saraffian family was indeed considered a German-Jewish couple (which we do not know) and not a Czech-Jewish mixed marriage, the family would have not been \u201cprivileged\u201d and Martha Saraffian and her daughter were still required to wear the patch: \u201cWe got these stars, my Jewish daughter and I. And we had to carry all the-- through the end of the war.\u201d Martha Saraffian also received ration cards marked with \u201cJew,\u201d which were considerably lower than those for non-Jews and even those for Jews in \u201cprivileged\u201d mixed marriages. Jews usually did not receive any rations of meat, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other essential foods. Even basic staples such as fat or salt were issued in insufficient amounts.  "

In July 1944 the Protectorate\u2019s labor offices summoned intermarried non-Jews and <em>Mischlinge</em> for forced labor duty. An internal document of the German State Minister for Bohemia and Moravia from late August 1944 stated: \u201cfirst degree Mischlinge and Aryans living in Jewish mixed marriages are called up for special labor assignment outside of their places of residence.

Hrand Saraffian was ordered to an unidentified coal town, where he had to clear rubble and other bomb damage caused by Allied aerial bombing.
