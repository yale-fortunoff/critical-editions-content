In 1931 she married Hrand Saraffian, an Armenian Christian refugee from Constantinople, with whom she had two daughters, Noemi and Hanna. Despite her civil marriage to a Protestant, Martha Saraffian remained a member of the Jewish community and their first daughter, Noemi, was raised as Jewish.

This crown land, one part of the historic Czech lands, which had received a certain degree of autonomy after the Austrian-Hungarian compromise of 1867, was the major site of an ongoing national conflict between Austrian Czechs and Austrian Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> The Czechs, who were the majority in Bohemia, had strived for national autonomy or even independence for decades. Most Germans in the region fiercely opposed any such initiative. Bohemia was therefore an epicenter of both German and Czech nationalism and radicalization. It is thus not surprising that in 1903 the German Workers’ Party, an early forerunner of the Austrian and German-Czech National Socialist movement, was founded in the heavily industrialized region. Bohemian Jews were caught in the middle of this national struggle between Czechs and Germans, which also extended to other regions of the monarchy, such as Moravia and even Vienna.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-13\"><a href=\"#fn-13\">13</a></sup> In the 18th and 19th centuries the majority of Bohemian Jews had identified as Germans, at least on paper, as the Austro-Hungarian system of nationality was based on self-identification and the self-declared everyday language of its citizens.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-14\"><a href=\"#fn-14\">14</a></sup> Hence these national identities were always fluid and never cemented. Identifications began to shift towards the Czech side at the turn of the century, especially in the Czech majority areas, and a vocal minority of Bohemian Jews also supported Zionism. However, many citizens of the region, whether Jewish or not, were in the truest sense “multicultural” and bilingual, at least to some degree, and shifting identifications were also a matter of political allegiances. According to the 1910 census, 62.66% of the inhabitants of Bohemia spoke Czech (including Slovakian) as their daily common language, whereas 36.45% were German speakers (in Austria-Hungary as a whole 23.36% were German speakers, 19.57% Hungarian speakers and 12.54% spoke Czech and Slovakian, the rest other languages).

German separatists began to refer to these regions, which did not form a political unity until the Nazi annexation in October 1938, as <i>Sudetenland</i>, the land of the Sudeten-Germans. While these areas were not granted any form of autonomy by the Czechoslovakian state, German was still used as an official administrative and educational language. In her testimony, Saraffian refers to this linguistic and political change in meaning: “And we moved to the Sudeten. At this time, it was Austria.

His decision was announced on September 29, 1941. In breaking with policy in Germany properand Austria, Jewish spouses in such marriages were to be treated just as all other Jews. This decision was reversed by the authorities in Berlin in October of the same year, when it was decided that, for the Protectorate’s German-Jewish marriages the exemptions would still apply, but not, however, for Czech-Jewish marriages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-64\"><a href=\"#fn-64\">64</a></sup> From this point onwards two different types of mixed marriages existed in the Protectorate. Essentially all Czech-Jewish marriages were robbed of their “privileges” and became merely “protected”. It is not clear how the Saraffian family was categorized in this respect, given their non-German citizenship and their statelessness. It should be noted that the relevant parts of the Nuremberg laws defining Jews and non-Jews did not differentiate based on citizenship but operated with the terms Jewish and “of German and related blood”. A person without German citizenship could thus still be “of German and related blood” and the marriage would still be considered “mixed” and protected. In fact, the German census contained information on intermarriages, with Germans and stateless persons in one category, and persons with foreign citizenships in the other. However, most exemptions and so-called “privileges” granted for mixed marriages only applied when there were no children raised as Jews. For example, the exemption from wearing the yellow star stated that the children must have been registered as non-Jews. In the Saraffian’s case, Noemi had been registered as Jewish, as her Trautenau citizen registration clearly shows, making her a “<i>Geltungsjüdin</i>,” a <i>Mischling</i> who was “deemed Jewish.” So even if the Saraffian family was indeed considered a German-Jewish couple (which we do not know) and not a Czech-Jewish mixed marriage, the family would have not been “privileged” and Martha Saraffian and her daughter were still required to wear the patch: “We got these stars, my Jewish daughter and I. And we had to carry all the-- through the end of the war.” Martha Saraffian also received ration cards marked with “Jew,” which were considerably lower than those for non-Jews and even those for Jews in “privileged” mixed marriages. Jews usually did not receive any rations of meat, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other essential foods. Even basic staples such as fat or salt were issued in insufficient amounts.
