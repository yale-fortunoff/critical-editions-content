In the 1930s many of them, like Zawistowska, joined the ranks of the Communist Party of Poland and, after World War II, worked to create a new political and social reality. Nevertheless, Zawistowska’s experience was in many respects exceptional. First of all, unlike 90% percent of Polish Jews, she survived the war. More significantly, her wartime odyssey encompassed so many different stages and places, far more than we would expect from a single biography spanning a short period of just a few years. Her activities in this period included: illegally crossing in fall 1939 the German-Soviet border established after the collapse and partition of the Polish state; living for more than a year and a half in the Soviet zone of occupation, first in Białystok and then in Galicia; time spent in the latter region under Hungarian and German rule in 1941-1942; escaping from Galicia under dramatic circumstances to reach the Warsaw ghetto, where she witnessed deportations to Treblinka; and two and a half years of hiding on the “Aryan side.” Even this last act was more dramatic and complicated than in the cases of many other Jews who survived. In the final months of the war, after the defeat of the Polish uprising in Warsaw in fall 1944, Zawistowska hid in the ruins of the city – like Władysław Szpilman, whose experience Roman Polański presented in the Oscar-winning film <i>The Pianist</i>.

The majority were traditional, religious Jews who did not fully assimilate. They spoke Yiddish, Polish being a second language with varying levels of command. They usually lived in different neighborhoods from ethnic Poles, dressed in a recognizable way, which significantly reduced their chances of hiding and surviving the German occupation.

She recounts a vibrant intellectual, cultural, and social life and brilliant professors, but also rising anti-Jewish sentiment and violence.

Zawistowska recalls in her testimony anti-Jewish riots on campus, instigated by right-wing Polish students. Jewish students were physically attacked and often severely beaten. The nationalist groups had two basic demands. The first was to reduce the number of Jews at the university (so called <i>numerus clausus</i>) so that Jewish students did not exceed their percentage in the overall population. Official restrictions were never formally implemented, but met some success in practice as the various local authorities within the different departments, e.g. medicine, decided who would be admitted to study. The second demand was the separation of Jewish and non-Jewish students, with separate seats in each university auditorium – so called “ghetto benches.” Separation was officially introduced at Warsaw University in 1937, after Zawistowska had graduated; but it had earlier been informally imposed by nationalist students who beat those Jews who did not comply and intimidated reluctant professors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\">6</a></sup> "}},{"id":"SegwrngUao","type":"footnoteParagraph","data":{"id":"fn-4","label":"4","text":"On these antisemitic movements and narratives see: Szymon Rudnicki, <i>Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny: geneza i działalność</i> (Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1985); Anna Landau-Czajka,. <i>W jednym stali domu: koncepcje rozwiązania kwestii żydowskiej w publicystyce polskie lat 1933-1939</i> (Warszawa: Wydawnictwo Neriton; Instytut Historii PAN, 1998).

In fact, she had begun to be politically involved even before she began her studies at Warsaw University. Still in Łęczyca, as a 16 year old high school pupil, she became a member of International Red Aid (known as MOPR from its Russian acronym, derived from: Международная организация помощи революциoнepaм). MOPR was a relief organization that helped left-wing political prisoners and organized propaganda campaigns in their defense.

Jews and other national minorities, in many ways discriminated against in interwar Poland, were highly overrepresented in the Communist movement, in which they saw an instrument for achieving a more just and equal social reality. In 1933, among members of the Communist Union of Polish Youth, to which Zawistowska belonged, Jews constituted 31 percent, Byelorussians 19 percent, Ukrainians 17 percent and ethnic Poles 33 percent (the latter constituted about two-thirds of the overall population). In the Communist Party of Poland in the 1930s the percentage of Jews oscillated around one quarter, but was much higher in its more important echelons. It is estimated that Jews constituted 75 percent of the apparatus for production and distribution of propaganda materials and occupied most of the seats on the Central Committee.

As a person known for her involvement in the Communist movement she could not get a job at any state-run school, and earned her living giving private lessons and looking after handicapped children in Jewish families. The outbreak of the war (September 1, 1939) caught her in Łódź, where her family had lived since 1935. She soon decided, as did many other dozens of thousands of Jews (not only Communists), to flee to the Soviet zone of the partitioned Poland. In September 1939 the Soviets, acting in cooperation with Nazi Germany, invaded Poland and annexed more than half of the Polish pre-war territory, which was incorporated into the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics. A risky but successful attempt saw Zawistowska cross the Soviet border and make it to Białystok, the largest town in the northern part of Soviet-occupied Poland, where many left-wing activists gathered. After some time she moved south, to Galicia, where she remained until the end of the Soviet rule in June 1941. She first worked in an orphanage in Stanisławów (nowadays in Ukraine: Ivano-Frankivsk), one of the most important cities in this region. After having completed courses for teachers, she moved to the countryside and taught in a village school, and later again in another school back in Stanisławów. Władysława Zawistowska benefited from new opportunities of employment and social advancement created by the Soviet authorities. Many Jews not accessible for such positions in prewar Poland could now occupy positions in the administration and education.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-12\"><a href=\"#fn-12\">12</a></sup> However, she was not enthusiastic about Soviet reality. It might sound a paradox for a Communist activist, dedicated to the cause and imprisoned in Poland, but in fact these feelings were shared by many who made it to the Soviet zone. Zawistowska married a Polish Jew from Warsaw who had also fled from the Germans. She recalls the poverty, and even hunger, that they experienced at that time, as well as fear and knowledge about Soviet repression.

The imagination of most Jews, even the most pessimistic (or realistic), did not conceive that the Nazis would attempt to kill every single one of them.

One other thing she mentions several times in her testimony is financial resources.

However, it was for them only a partial and temporary relief in the ongoing ordeal. The civilian population suffered from German bombardments. Zawistowska, along with other dwellers of their building sought shelter in cellars, but her brother in law stayed in the apartment, despite a real danger of being harmed or killed by bombs. What they both feared more was that neighbors would recognize him as a Jew. Zawistowska witnessed searches for Jews in cellars by armed Polish nationalists, “bandits” as she rightly said in her testimony. Once recognized, Jews were taken out and executed.

It was a very risky endeavor, since the Germans executed those who were caught, and the deserted city was regularly searched by special units whose task was to blow up and burn remaining buildings. They ate what they found in adjacent cellars and were lucky that the omnipresent rats were more interested in the piles of corpses.

At the end of the 1980s she began cooperation with a Jewish language newspaper, <i>Folks-Sztyme</i> (People’s Voice), published in Warsaw, and later became active in animating Jewish cultural and social initiatives. She mentions in her testimony organizing in the 1990s a public discussion of revelations about murders of Jews during the Warsaw uprising. For her this was not only a part of the history of Polish Jews, long silenced, but also a very real experience she witnessed herself. Zawistowska’s biography indeed offers insights into many dimensions of the fate of Polish Jews in the 20th century. It should be studied by researchers dealing not only with the Holocaust but also many other topics, including the secularization of the younger generation of Jews in prewar Poland, their involvement in the Communist movement and the disillusionment that they eventually faced.
