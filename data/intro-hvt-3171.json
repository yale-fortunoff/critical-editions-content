The Stations of the Cross were recreated in the town, based on a map of Jerusalem, and the small town was officially renamed Nowa Jerozolima (New Jerusalem). With the growing secularization of the early nineteenth century, the town returned to its original name, and Jews began to settle there.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\">2</a></sup> In 1859 the Chassidic religious leader <em>tzaddik</em> Yitzchak Meir Rotenberg-Alter, the first of the Ger Chassidic dynasty, settled in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria (Ger in Yiddish). He set up his court on Pijarska Street. The town soon became the most influential Chassidic center in the Kingdom of Poland. During the period discussed by Prajs, the Chassidic court of Ger was headed by Avraham Mordechai Alter (1864\u20121948)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\">3</a></sup>. Jewish pilgrimages to G\u00f3ra Kalwaria were encouraged with the 1899 opening of the G\u00f3ra Kalwaria-Warsaw narrow-gauge railway, colloquially called the \u2018rebbe railway.' Tzaddik Alter was its unofficial shareholder. Aside from religious functions, the tzaddik's court was also an important social and political center \u2013 as evidenced by the fact that <em>Agudat Yisrael</em>, a party representing Orthodox Jews, had its seat in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\">4</a></sup>"

He and his wife Golda had six children, including Jankiel, Henryk's father. Jankiel Prajs married Estera Frydman from the village of Coniew, near G\u00f3ra Kalwaria. He was a petty merchant without his own stall and she was a seamstress. Henryk's parents did not wear the traditional attire. His mother did not shave her head and went to the synagogue only once a year, on Yom Kippur. Jankiel went to the synagogue more often, but not every Saturday. The family spoke Yiddish at home, cooked kosher food, and celebrated religious holidays. There were two synagogues in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria, one belonging to the <em>Alter tzaddik</em> dynasty and the other to the Reformed Jewish Community, and the Prajs family frequented the latter.

A squadron consisted of approximately a hundred soldiers, with four Jewish soldiers in each squadron. This means that the Jewish soldiers constituted four percent of the soldiers, while making up nine percent of the overall population of Poland. Prajs retained very fond memories of his military service. Public appearances in the <em>uhlan</em> uniform and horse-riding-shoes and with a saber by his side clearly impressed him.

This is how Prajs described the conditions in the ghetto after its closure in testimony submitted to the Jewish Historical Institute: \"The situation became even worse.

Another group was comprised of Jews evacuated by the Soviet authorities from the German-occupied areas in 1941, including members of the communist party, administrative staff, skilled workers, and men capable of military service.

The accusation that Jews had kidnapped a Polish boy for ritual slaughter led to a pogrom, as a result of which 42 people died and 40 were wounded. It also led to antisemitic incidents in several localities in the Kielce region and an intensification of Jewish emigration. During the three months following the pogrom, 60,000 Jews left the country. The total number of Jews who left Poland between 1945 and 1947 is estimated at 140,000. M.

        "text": "In Prajs' account, Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski appears as a defender of the Jews persecuted by the Communists. A fragment of his sermon delivered at the Warsaw Cathedral on April 11, 1968 is sometimes quoted in the Polish Catholic press as proof of the Primate's objection to the anti-Zionist campaign. This is what Wyszy\u0144ski said in his sermon: \"\u2026we are currently witnessing such painful experiences and such a painful spectacle that the heart is simply crunching from the pain felt when one looks at all this and hears about this. It seems as if a certain category of people in Poland lack love and a right to a heart.\"<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-36\"><a href=\"#fn-36\">36</a></sup> He then called for the rejection of lies and hatred \u2013 but he did not  use the words 'Jews,' 'Zionism,' etc. even once. If Wyszy\u0144ski was indeed referring to the antisemitic campaign, he did so cryptically, and only a small percentage of those who heard him would have been able to decipher his meaning. What is more, his audience was limited to those then present inside the cathedral, as the sermon was not broadcast on radio, television or published in the press. Therefore, the impact of Wyszy\u0144ski's words must have been minimal. The Primate did not send a letter to the faithful, publish a statement, or send any instructions to the clergy relating in any way to the anti-Zionist campaign conducted by the authorities. Historians agree that Wyszy\u0144ski regarded the campaign as an internal game played within the Communist Party, in which the Catholic Church should not take part.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-37\"><a href=\"#fn-37\">37</a></sup> So what was the source of Prajs' belief in the pro-Jewish stance of the head of the Polish Church? Primate Wyszy\u0144ski has been an icon of recent Polish history for several decades. He is presented as a great national and spiritual leader, a man of great courage, wisdom, shrewdness, and benevolence. Prajs internalized that view to such an extent that, in his eyes, Wyszy\u0144ski, a positive hero in Polish history, must have opposed the Communist authorities in 1968 and must have defended the Jews. As one can see, Prajs' Jewishness and Polishness was a patchwork woven from different traditions, myths and beliefs. Prajs learned to ignore some of the threads threatening the integrity of the cloth, while other threads he rewove in such a way that they fitted the prevailing beliefs about the past among his Polish milieu."
