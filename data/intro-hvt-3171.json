This heterogenous group consisted of Jewish refugees who left the German-occupied territories of pre-war Poland in 1939 and fled to the territories annexed by the Soviet Union. 70,000 Jewish refugees (the <i>biezhentsy</i>) refused to accept Soviet citizenship. Deemed a 'socially hostile' element, they were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan in 1940. Another 20,000 Jews were detained in Soviet labor camps for \"illegal crossing of the German-Soviet border\" – and (paradoxically) were thereby saved. Another group was comprised of Jews evacuated by the Soviet authorities from the German-occupied areas in 1941, including members of the communist party, administrative staff, skilled workers, and men capable of military service. The last group was comprised of Jews returning from the east who had survived the German occupation in hiding. At the same time, Jewish survivors of German camps (about 50,000 people) were returning to their hometowns along with those who had survived the occupation in hiding or on Polish papers, like Prajs.

A fragment of his sermon delivered at the Warsaw Cathedral on April 11, 1968 is sometimes quoted in the Polish Catholic press as proof of the Primate's objection to the anti-Zionist campaign. This is what Wyszyński said in his sermon: \"…we are currently witnessing such painful experiences and such a painful spectacle that the heart is simply crunching from the pain felt when one looks at all this and hears about this. It seems as if a certain category of people in Poland lack love and a right to a heart.\"<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-36\"><a href=\"#fn-36\">36</a></sup> He then called for the rejection of lies and hatred – but he did not  use the words 'Jews,' 'Zionism,' etc. even once. If Wyszyński was indeed referring to the antisemitic campaign, he did so cryptically, and only a small percentage of those who heard him would have been able to decipher his meaning. What is more, his audience was limited to those then present inside the cathedral, as the sermon was not broadcast on radio, television or published in the press. Therefore, the impact of Wyszyński's words must have been minimal. The Primate did not send a letter to the faithful, publish a statement, or send any instructions to the clergy relating in any way to the anti-Zionist campaign conducted by the authorities. Historians agree that Wyszyński regarded the campaign as an internal game played within the Communist Party, in which the Catholic Church should not take part.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref-37\"><a href=\"#fn-37\">37</a></sup> So what was the source of Prajs' belief in the pro-Jewish stance of the head of the Polish Church? Primate Wyszyński has been an icon of recent Polish history for several decades. He is presented as a great national and spiritual leader, a man of great courage, wisdom, shrewdness, and benevolence. Prajs internalized that view to such an extent that, in his eyes, Wyszyński, a positive hero in Polish history, must have opposed the Communist authorities in 1968 and must have defended the Jews. As one can see, Prajs' Jewishness and Polishness was a patchwork woven from different traditions, myths and beliefs. Prajs learned to ignore some of the threads threatening the integrity of the cloth, while other threads he rewove in such a way that they fitted the prevailing beliefs about the past among his Polish milieu."}},{"id":"J82WKlg8RS","type":"footnoteParagraph","data":{"id":"fn-36","label":"36","text":"Quoted in Tomasz Wiścicki, \"Biskupi o Marcu 1969,\" 6 March 2018, eKAI, <a href=\"https://www.ekai.pl/biskupi-o-marcu-1968/\">https://www.ekai.pl/biskupi-o-marcu-1968/</a>.
